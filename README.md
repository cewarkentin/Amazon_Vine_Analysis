# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

Looking at data for items labeled as "musical instruments" sold on Amazon, we determined if there was any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members within dataset.

## Purpose

## Results

There is a bulleted list that addresses the three questions for unpaid and paid program reviews

- How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
- How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
- What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

determine if there is any bias towards reviews that were written as part of the Vine program. For this analysis, you'll determine if having a paid Vine review makes a difference in the percentage of 5-star reviews
